# Expense Manager

A simple web application developed out of leisure time & coffee that helps you keep track of your income & expenses including useful tools to help you analyze and visualize your expenditures.

## Description

This is a simple web application built to help you keep track of your expenses and easily analyze them. This is the frontend part of the code and it uses a backend API [https://github.com/deveshpatel0101/expense-manager-api](https://github.com/deveshpatel0101/expense-manager-api). This frontend application is built using ReactJS as the main library and Chartjs to visualize graphically your expenses. Upon immediate load of the page, it makes a call to the backend API and if you are not authorized, a prompt will open up and you will be asked to enter a password. Unfortunately, this application is built only for a single user and there is no sign-up method available.

As of now the application is hosted on [https://expense-manager.cyclic.app/](https://expense-manager.cyclic.app/). As it is a single user application, you will be prompted to enter a password and you won't be able to access any features of the application.

## Installation
